# Business Understanding

In Tanzania, over 57 million people rely on wells for their daily water supply. Unfortunately, many of these wells either break down or fall into disrepair, leaving communities without clean water for long periods.

The challenge is simple: can we predict whether a well is functional, needs repair, or is non-functional?

## Problem Statement

Thousands of wells fail due to poor maintenance, unsuitable technology, or lack of timely intervention. This project applies machine learning to predict the status of wells, so stakeholders can target repairs more efficiently and reduce wasted resources.

## Objectives

* Find the key drivers of well failures.

* Build a predictive model to classify well functionality.

* Provide clear insights and visualizations for decision-makers.

## Success Metrics

* ≥75% accuracy in predicting well status.

* Strong recall (≈75%) on non-functional wells.

* Clear, interpretable results that NGOs and governments can act on.
